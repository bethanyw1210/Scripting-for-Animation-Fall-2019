  storyText: 'You chose cat number 3, the white tom! You scoop him up and hold him
    in your arms. You don''t sunggle him because he is too dignified for that behavior.
    You can tell he isn''t particularly enjoying being held, but he is accepting it.
    The two of you spend a happy life together with a shared mutual respect and dignity.
