  storyText: "The third cat is a pure white, blue-eyed tom. He is long and lanky with
    short fur. He has a mysterious air to him. He is sweet and gentle but also acts
    with authority. It's almost as if it's a gift when he allows you to pet him. He
    isn't much of a cuddler but he stas next to your side the whole time. He always
    lays where he is just in your reach. \n\n1) Go back"
