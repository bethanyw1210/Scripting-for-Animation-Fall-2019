  storyText: "The first cat is a beautiful long-haired maine coon. She has the typical
    brown tabby stripe markings a main coon has, but she also has some orange spots
    speckiling her back. Her tail is long and bushy, like a cloud. You notice that
    she seems to be more the type of cat who just wants to cuddle. She is very sweet
    and seems to never stop purring. She loves to be pet and head boops your hand
    when you stop, as if she's asking you to continue. \n\n1) Go back "
